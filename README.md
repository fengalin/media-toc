# <a name='how-tos'></a>How-tos

## <a name='how-to-create-the-toc'></a>Create the table of contents

1. Click on the folder icon or the play icon to open the file selection dialog.
2. Select the mkv media for which you want to add a table of contents.
3. If you want to add a chapter starting at the begining of the file, you can click on the `+` icon
under the tree view at the bottom right of the window. The end of the chapter will match the end
of the media. This will change automatically if you add new chapters.
4. Click in the newly added chapter title column and fill the title for this chapter.
5. Play the stream until the next chapter's starting position. You can use the timeline to seek
in the media.
6. In order to precisely define the start of the new chapter, pause the media by clicking on the
play/pause button, then use the `+` button next to the waveform to zoom in. You can then seek around
current sample by clicking on the waveform. You can also play the media in current time frame by
right clicking at the starting position. Use the zoom, left click and right click until you reach
the position for the chapter to add.
7. When the cursor (the vertical yellow bar) matches the start of the chapter to add, click on the
`+` icon under the tree view at the bottom right of the window.
8. If you want to modify chapters boundary, click and drag the boundary to modify to the desired
position. Note: this operation is only available in paused mode.
9. Click in the newly added chapter title column and fill a title for this chapter.
10. Go back to step 5 if you wish to add another chapter.

## <a name='how-to-save-the-toc'></a>Save the table of contents

You can export a table of contents to the `mkvmerge simple chapter format` which is a text file.
This file will be stored in the same folder as the original media and will be automatically loaded
next time you open this media.

1. Define the chapters as explained in [this how-to](#how-to-create-the-toc).
2. Switch to the Export perspective using the selector on the left side of the header bar.
3. Select `mkvmerge text format`.
4. Click on `Export`. When the export is complete, a new file with the same name as your media and
with a `txt` extension will be created in the media's folder.

## <a name='export-to-mkv'></a>Export the resulting media with its table of contents to a Matroska container

Currently, this is only possible if the input streams are compatible with Matroska containers.

Warning: this also requires [`gst-plugins-good` 1.14](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.14/)
or above.

1. Open a media with a table of contents, define the chapters as explained in [this how-to](#how-to-create-the-toc)
or open a media for which you already defined a table of contents (see [this how-to](#how-to-save-the-toc)).
2. Switch to the Streams perspective using the selector on the left side of the header bar.
3. Tick the streams to export (all streams are ticked by default).
4. Switch to the Export perspective using the selector on the left side of the header bar.
5. Select `Matroska Container`.
6. Click on `Export`. When the export is complete, a new file with the same name as your media and
ending with `.toc.mkv` will be created in the media's folder.

## <a name='split-to-audio'></a>Split the audio stream into one file per chapter

1. Open a media with a table of contents, define the chapters as explained in [this how-to](#how-to-create-the-toc)
or open a media for which you already defined a table of contents (see [this how-to](#how-to-save-the-toc)).
2. Switch to the Streams perspective using the selector on the left side of the header bar.
3. Select the audio stream to split.
4. Switch to the Split perspective using the selector on the left side of the header bar.
5. Select to desired output format: `flac`, `wave`, `opus`, `vorbis` or `mp3`.
6. Click on `Split`. When the split is complete, audio files will be created in the media's folder.
The files are named after the artist, media title, chapter number and chapter title.

## <a name='use-mkvmerge'></a>Use `mkvmerge` to add the toc to an existing Matrsoka media

Exporting the table of contents to a Matroska container requires [`gst-plugins-good` 1.14](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.14/)
or above. If you use an ealier version, follow these instructions:

1. Install `mkvtoolnix` using your package manager.
2. Export your table of contents to the `mkvmerge simple chapter format` (see [this how-to](#how-to-save-the-toc)).
3. Open a terminal and `cd` to the directory where your Matroska file is located.
4. Issue the following command (where _media_ is the name of your mkv file without the extension):
    ```
    mkvmerge --chapters _media_.txt -o output_file.mkv _media_.mkv
    ```

The file `output_file.mkv` will now contain the media with the chapters you defined.

# <a name='technologies'></a>Technologies
**media-toc** is developed in Rust and uses the following technologies:
- **GTK-3** ([official documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/),
[Rust binding](http://gtk-rs.org/docs/gtk/)) and [Glade](https://glade.gnome.org/).
- **Cairo** ([official documentation](https://www.cairographics.org/documentation/),
[Rust binding](http://gtk-rs.org/docs/cairo/index.html)).
- **GStreamer** ([official documentation](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/),
[Rust binding](https://sdroege.github.io/rustdoc/gstreamer/gstreamer/)).

# <a name='build-env'></a>Build environment
## Toolchain
```
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
Select the `stable` toolchain. See the full documentation
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs#installation).

It is convenience to have Rust's tools in the path. On linux, you might want to add this
in your `.bashrc`:
```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.cargo/bin
```

## Dependencies
Rust dependencies are handled by [Cargo](http://doc.crates.io/). You will also
need the following packages installed on your OS:

### Fedora
```
sudo dnf install gcc gtk3-devel glib2-devel gstreamer1-devel \
	gstreamer1-plugins-base-devel gstreamer1-plugins-{good,bad-free,ugly-free} \
	gstreamer1-libav
```

### Debian & Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install gcc libgtk-3-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
	libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-{good,bad,ugly} \
	gstreamer1.0-libav
```

### macOS
```
brew install gtk+3 gstreamer
brew install --with-libvorbis --with-opus --with-theora gst-plugins-base
brew install --with-flac --with-gtk+3 --with-libpng --with-taglib gst-plugins-good
brew install --with-srt gst-plugins-bad
brew install --with-libmpeg2 --with-x264 gst-plugins-ugly
```

The package `adwaita-icon-theme` might allow installing the missing icons, but
it fails while compiling the Rust compiler (which is used to compile `librsvg`).
I'll try to configure the formula so that it uses the installed compiler when I
get time.

Use the following command to build and generate locales:
```
PATH="/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH" cargo build --release
```

### Windows
- MSYS2: follow [this guide](http://www.msys2.org/).
- Install the development toolchain, GTK and GStreamer<br>
Note: for a 32bits system, use `mingw-w64-i686-...`
```
pacman --noconfirm -S gettext-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-gstreamer
pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-plugins-{base,good,bad,ugly} mingw-w64-x86_64-gst-libav
pacman --noconfirm -S mingw-w64-x86_64-adwaita-icon-theme
```

- Launch the [rustup installer](https://www.rustup.rs/).
When asked for the default host triple, select `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` (or
`i686-pc-windows-gnu` for a 32bits system), then select `stable`.
- From a MSYS2 mingw shell
  - add cargo to the `PATH`:
  ```
  echo 'PATH=$PATH:/c/Users/'$USER'/.cargo/bin' >> /home/$USER/.bashrc
  ```
  - Restart the MSYS2 shell before using `cargo`.

# <a name='build-run'></a>Build and run
Use Cargo (from the root of the project):
```
cargo run --release
```

On XDG compliant systems, you can install the application executable and related
files (icons, translations and desktop file) for current user by executing the
following command (from the root of the project):
```
bash target/install
```

You can uninstall with:
```
bash target/uninstall
```

# <a name='troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting

## Can't play a video file or the UI doesn't refresh properly

This might be caused by the hardware acceleration which is enabled by default.
In some cases, the application will detect the issue and disable it automatically
(a restart is required). But in other cases, you may have to disable it by hand.
First check that hardware acceleration is indeed the issue:
```
cargo run -- --disable-gl
```

If it solves the problem, you can permanently disable hardware acceleration by editing
the configuration file. The configuration location depends on the operating system:


| OS          | Configuration location                                                       |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux based | ~/.config/media-toc/config.ron                                               |
| macOS       | /Users/_user_/Library/Preferences/org.fengalin.media-toc/config.ron          |
| Windows     | C:\\Users\\_user_\\AppData\\Roaming\\fengalin\\media-toc\\config\\config.ron |


Open the configuration file and replace the following line:
```
        is_gl_disabled: false,
```
with:
```
        is_gl_disabled: true,
```

## Issue with translations

When you launch the application, if the labels are broken, you can disable the
translation using the following command:

```
LC_MESSAGES=C cargo run
```
